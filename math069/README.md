# Project Euler Problem 69: Totient maximum

Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9) = 6.

The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1) = 1.

Interestingly, φ(87109) = 79180, and it happens to be a maximum, as 87109 is the product of two prime numbers, 7919 and 11.

It can be observed that n/φ(n) for n ≤ 10 is 6. For a range of values of n, find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.
